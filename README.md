### This is my personal VS Code theme, focused mainly on readability.

<br>
<br>

## Example:

![Example](images/example.png)

<br>

## Entire screen example:

![Entire screen example](images/entire_screen.png)

<br>

<br>

## Supported languages:

- **Rust**
- **Toml**
- **Markdown**

### I can't garuntee that I'll support other languages and/or take fixes/suggestions, but it's not impossible
