### This is my personal VS Code theme, focused mainly on readability.

## Example:

<br>

## Supported languages:

- **Rust**
- **Toml**
- **Markdown**

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Suggested settings:

```
{
	"editor.letterSpacing": 0.1,
	"editor.lineHeight": 1.3,
	"editor.fontLigatures": true,
	"terminal.integrated.smoothScrolling": true,
	"editor.cursorBlinking": "solid",
}
```

### I can't garuntee that I'll support other languages and/or take fixes/suggestions, but it's not impossible
